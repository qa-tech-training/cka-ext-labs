# cka-ext-labs
Extra/alternative labs for the CKA course

## Motivation
These labs are intended as a _supplement to_ the official CKA labs as maintianed by the Linux Foundation. The official labs are an effective way to build the competence and 'muscle memory' required for the CKA exam but often leave learners who are new to Kubernetes and its' constructs confused as to the purpose of the constructs and applicability to their use cases. Theory slides and instructor-led demos are not always helpful in this regard either as they are too hands-off.

The aim of these labs, therefore, is to provide outcome-focused activities which allow learners to experience kubernetes constructs not in isolation but in combination, hopefully making the utility of these constructs more obvious. 

## Labs
* Autoscaling and Performance Management
* NetSec and Troubleshooting - deploy a webserver, exposed by an ingress via cross-namespace routing, whilst adhering to security and resource consumption policies and troubleshooting misconfigurations as necessary.
